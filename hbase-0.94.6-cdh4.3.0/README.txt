Apache HBase [1] is an open-source, distributed, versioned, column-oriented
store modeled after Google' Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for
Structured Data by Chang et al.[2]  Just as Bigtable leverages the distributed
data storage provided by the Google File System, HBase provides Bigtable-like
capabilities on top of Apache Hadoop [3].

To get started using HBase, the full documentation for this release can be
found under the doc/ directory that accompanies this README.  Using a browser,
open the docs/index.html to view the project home page (or browse to [1]).
The hbase 'book' at docs/book.html has a 'quick start' section and is where you
should being your exploration of the hbase project.

The latest HBase can be downloaded from an Apache Mirror [4].
