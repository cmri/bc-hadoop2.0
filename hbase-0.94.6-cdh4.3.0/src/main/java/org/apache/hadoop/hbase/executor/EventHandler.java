/**
 * Abstract base class for all HBase event handlers. Subclasses should
 * implement the {@link #process()} method.  Subclasses should also do all
 * necessary checks up in their constructor if possible -- check table exists,
 * is disabled, etc. -- so they fail fast rather than later when process is
 * running.  Do it this way because process be invoked directly but event
 * handlers are also
 * run in an executor context -- i.e. asynchronously -- and in this case,
 * exceptions thrown at process time will not be seen by the invoker, not till
 * we implement a call-back mechanism so the client can pick them up later.
 * <p>
 * Event handlers have an {@link EventType}.
 * {@link EventType} is a list of ALL handler event types.  We need to keep
 * a full list in one place -- and as enums is a good shorthand for an
 * implemenations -- because event handlers can be passed to executors when
 * they are to be run asynchronously. The
 * hbase executor, see {@link ExecutorService}, has a switch for passing
 * event type to executor.
 * <p>
 * Event listeners can be installed and will be called pre- and post- process if
 * this EventHandler is run in a Thread (its a Runnable so if its {@link #run()}
 * method gets called).  Implement
 * {@link EventHandlerListener}s, and registering using
 * {@link #setListener(EventHandlerListener)}.
